# Interview Scheduler

The interview scheduler (iwscheduler) is a small application, built primarily for demo and teaching purposes. It was written in Kotlin and uses Spring Boot for dependency injection and component orchestration. The goal of this application is to demonstrate a simple end-to-end Spring Boot application, by wrapping it in a simple case scenario. It has one main API endpoint, which allows for checking the matching availability between interview candidates, and interviewers (assuming that the availability of the separate parties has been saved in the system upfront).
